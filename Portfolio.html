                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I first came into contact with programming through courses offered by my highschool and my older brother who is a web developer. From a young age, I was constantly being exposed to technology and ended up falling in love with what technology is capable of accomplishing. I was curious to learn more and decided to go to college for Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>I am currently a hardworking and dedicated student with a passion for developing software. I am entering into my senior year of college at Kean University. During my time here at Kean University and Union County College respectively, I have created and collaborated on a variety of software projects composed of different programming languages and technologies.</p>
                    <p>Alongside going to school, creating software projects, and working a full time job, I have strengthened core values such as my work ethic and time management skills. My goal is to become a knowledgeable and productive software engineer in the field. To accomplish this goal of mine, I am constantly developing new projects, learning new technologies/languages, and learning new ways to create better software.</p>
